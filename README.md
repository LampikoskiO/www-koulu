Completed Tasks:
1.	Basic Node.js and Express Setup (1p):
 		We created a Node.js project.Set up a basic Express server (in app.js) that listens on a port defined in the .env file.
	
 2.	Basic MVC Folder Structure (1p):
		We established the folder structure with folders for Models, Views, Controllers, Routes, and Public.

 3.	Database Connection Setup (1p):
		We set up a connection to a local MariaDB using Sequelize (in db.js), with connection details read from the .env file.

	
 4.	Implementing a Simple Data Model (1p):
		We created a simple Cat model (in models/cat.js) with fields such as title, content, imageUrl, and timestamps.
	
 5.	Read/Write Basic Data to Persistent Storage (1p):
		We implemented controller functions (in controllers/catController.js) and corresponding routes (in routes/catRoutes.js) to create and retrieve cat posts.
		These endpoints allow basic data insertion (POST) and retrieval (GET) from your MariaDB database.
	
 6.	Basic Git Usage (1p):
		Git has been initialized, and initial commits have been made.
